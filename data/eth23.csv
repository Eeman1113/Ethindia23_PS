"▼🔨 Don’t be a Tool, use a Polygon Tool ⸺ $4,000Up to 4 teams will receive $1,000We know that building a dApp that queries blockchain data can be cumbersome. With the Chain Indexer Framework you can unlock the true potential of EVM blockchains by seamlessly integrating them into your data infrastructure. Whether you are building real-time analytics, decentralised applications, or any other data-driven solution, this framework assists you in developing robust and efficient event-driven data pipelines on EVM blockchains.
Some Sample Use-Cases:
- Wallet Services: Blockchain indexers can help wallet providers offer more features like transaction history, balance history, and real-time updates.
- dApp Backend: dApps often require real-time access to contract events, token transactions, and other on-chain activities. A data indexer can speed up this process considerably.
- Analytics and Monitoring: Firms specialising in blockchain analytics use indexers to monitor activities like fraudulent transactions, smart contract interactions, and trends in token transfers.
- Cross-Chain Services: For cross-chain swaps or interactions, indexers can offer data that facilitates more seamless integrations.
- Oracles: Data indexers can support oracles by providing them with a more efficient way to access specific data points on the blockchain.
- NFT Marketplaces: To track ownership changes, price histories, and various attributes of NFTs, data indexers are often used in the backend.Qualification RequirementsDeploy the Chain Indexer Framework and integrate it to a smart contract on Polygon zkEVM and provide links to your deployment and your deployed smart contract addresses.Links and ResourcesNpm install @maticnetwork/chain-indexer-frameworkhttps://github.com/0xPolygon/chain-indexer-framework↗Githubhttps://github.com/0xPolygon/chain-indexer-framework↗Wikihttps://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/tools/chain-indexer-framework/overview/↗","Problem Statement: Building a dApp that queries blockchain data can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
